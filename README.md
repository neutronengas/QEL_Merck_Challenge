# Project Context & Executive Summary
The Quantum Entrepreneurship Laboratory is a project-based course at TUM that brings together Masters students of different backgrounds with reputable industry partners and selected quantum specialists to explore new commercial applications of quantum computing. 

Our team, QUEST, aims to solve real-world challenges in the pharmaceutical industry together with our challenge partner, Merck Group. We utilized the potential of quantum technologies by building a technical proof of concept and a business model to make a product to solve the problem we identified. Specifically the difficulty associated with production ramp up for new and existing drug formulations and currently missing product level sustainability. The course lasted over 16 weeks and at the end, a demo day took place where the teams presented their pitches of their business ideas to the challenge partners and jury members. The video of the demo day can be found here (timestamped to the beginning of the pitch for QUEST).
